# 🎓 Student Exam Performance Prediction

This project is designed to predict student exam results (Pass/Fail) using machine learning models based on academic behavior data such as attendance, study hours, sleep patterns, and stress levels. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment using Streamlit.
